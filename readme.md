# Skill data descriptions
This is a fork of UmaTL's repository providing skill descriptions based on raw data extracted from the game.  
It is made for Hachimi.

# Install / Use
Download the repo and extract it inside the hachimi folder
You will need the windows fonts (included_win) from UmaTL in order for the bolded text to be displayed properly (for skill effects)

> [!CAUTION] 
> There may be some cases that the skill description might not fit the textbox because of skill activation conditions being very long, and in some instances have multiple triggers or effects (I will try to reword them if possible, or just let it overflow because if the fonts is too small it's unreadable)
> Do **NOT** use this on the **JAPANESE VERSION**, use the UmaTL's Skill Data instead!

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> The skill data is based on the Global Version
> if there's any skill activation conditions or effects that are different from whats stated from gametora (or the master.mdb), please let me know so i could fix it ASAP
